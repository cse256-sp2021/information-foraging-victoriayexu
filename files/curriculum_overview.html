        <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>

        <p>
          At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are
          unique individuals with their own patterns and timetables for social,
          emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We support and
          encourage their development through our child-centered,
          process-oriented, playbased curriculum built on Constructivist
          theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational
          theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we
          create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs
          of the whole child by:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are
            relevant to the students, with the understanding that knowledge is
            constructed through language, discussion, experimentation, and
            manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them
          </li>
          <li>
            Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of
            materials, engage multiple senses, and encourage exploration,
            investigation, and learning
          </li>
          <li>
            Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own
            pace, and creating opportunities for children to explore
            individually, with a partner, or with a larger group of peers
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to
            thoughtfully form responses, listening respectfully to their
            replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they seek as
            they develop enhanced reasoning skills
          </li>
          <li>
            Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and
            empowering students to become problem solvers
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural
            population to highlight the similarities and differences between
            individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the unique
            environment that is Washington University Nursery School.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is
          presented in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on
          our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play.
          Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers
          experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks,
          manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into account the
          social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of
          each child.

          <p>
            At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many
            opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We
            value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building
            blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is
            on the process of exploring materials and how they can be
            manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We
            allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
            successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether
            undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a
            child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen
            confidence and emotional well-being while building independence.
            Materials and experiences include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk •
              Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves,
              vegetables, and other materials and items
            </li>
            <li>
              Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other
              objects
            </li>
            <li>
              Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and
              modeling
            </li>
            <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
            <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
            <li>
              Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper,
              pictures, and a variety of threedimensional items
            </li>
            <li>
              Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes,
              cartons, and other recyclable materials

            Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring
            visual arts, music and drama with specialists in these areas, in
            addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their
            everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground.

            The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and
            assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers
            consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
            meet students’ needs.

          <p>
            If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum
            may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the
              child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student
              confidence
            </li>
            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>

            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
            <li>
              Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than
              previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in
              the learning process
            </li>
            <li>
              Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities

          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring).
            Teachers take note of students’ activities throughout the year in
            order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group
            needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall
            conference is informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them
            the activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions
            they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
            Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment
            form covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal
            observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
            child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference
            so that parents have time to read and understand the material, and
            form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
