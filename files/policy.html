        <h2>
          Below is information on our policies and procedures, which can also be
          found in the Parent Handbook.
        </h2>
        <button class="accordion">Parking</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These
            three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school
            day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3
            parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit
            should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located
            off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is
            $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide
            validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special
            school events.<br /><br />
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Clothing</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are
            comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and
            outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing
            appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should
            be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as
            outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the
            winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will
            usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill
            taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent
            marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Snacks</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the
            children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pears, bananas, melons,
            etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s
            refrigerator.” There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham,
            Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists of a fruit,
            crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own
            water.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Birthday Celebrations</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            We celebrate each child’s birthday (or half-birthday for children
            with summer dates). If desired, talk with your child’s teacher about
            bringing a special snack to share with the class.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Holidays</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            We are fortunate to have diverse cultures and religious beliefs in
            our nursery school community. Our policy is to celebrate family
            traditions, not the religious aspects, of holidays.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

        <button class="accordion">Field Trips</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            Teachers frequently plan short walking trips on campus.
            Occasionally, trips are planned offcampus to further enhance the
            children’s experiences. Each time an off-campus trip is 11 planned,
            parents will be notified in advance and required to sign a form
            granting permission for the child’s participation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Medication</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at
            home and <strong>not</strong> at school. The nursery school staff
            does not routinely administer medications to the children. Also, we
            do not apply sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that
            absolutely needs to be administered during school hours must be
            cleared with the director.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Allergies</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            If your child has a known allergic reaction, this must be documented
            on the child’s History and Health Record kept in his/ her file in
            the office. Also, please report these allergies to the classroom
            teachers. For your child’s safety, these allergies will be posted in
            your child’s classroom. If you object to this information being
            posted, please contact the director. In case of severe allergies
            such as to bee stings or nuts, an EpiPen Injector Kit may be kept at
            the nursery school and used by the director and/or teachers who are
            trained in its administration. This is stored in the emergency
            backpack in the child’s classroom. Each classroom has a First Aid
            Kit that includes the EpiPen (if required). This, along with
            emergency medical forms for every child, accompanies the classes on
            all walking or driving field trips.

        <button class="accordion">Peanut and Tree Nut Policy</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            A growing number of children deal with food allergies and,
            specifically, potentially lifethreatening peanut and tree nut
            allergies. Washington University Nursery School will be a peanut-
            and tree nut-free (Brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios,
            walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts) preschool beginning with the
            2017-2018 school year. The full explanation of the Peanut and Tree
            Nut Policy describes how teachers and families will support the
            efforts of safeguarding the health and safety of the children.
          </p>

        <button class="accordion">Accidents</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            The nursery school makes every effort to ensure the safety of all
            children. However, should a serious accident occur, a parent is
            immediately contacted. If parents and emergency contacts cannot be
            reached, we will take your child to the hospital designated on your
            enrollment form. Minor injuries will be reported to you by your
            child’s teacher at pick-up. All injuries will also be reported in
            written form and given to you at pickup time. We will ask you to
            sign an identical form to be placed in your child’s file at school.
          </p>
          <br />

        <button class="accordion">Health Policy</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            The nursery school makes a great effort to provide a healthy
            environment for your children. We work diligently on forming healthy
            habits such as washing hands before eating or handling food, and
            after toileting. Our dishes and cups are put through a dishwasher/
            sanitizer to sterilize them and to prevent the spread of germs. The
            rooms are thoroughly 12 cleaned daily and checked for safety.
            However, despite everyone’s best efforts, children and adults will
            get sick. It is an expected part of life. If children become ill at
            school, they will be cared for in the office until a parent can pick
            them up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents are requested to keep their child home in the event of the
            diseases or symptoms noted below. The child will be allowed to
            return to school when he or she has been free of these symptoms and
            has not required medication for a minimum of 24 hours. If a symptom
            persists (such as rash or cough), or if a communicable disease is
            confirmed (measles, chicken pox, etc.), returning to school may
            require a statement from the child’s physician declaring that the
            condition is no longer contagious.
          </p>
          <p>
            PLEASE CALL the nursery school to inform us that your child is sick,
            especially if he/ she has a communicable disease. Communicable
            diseases or conditions include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            strep throat, chicken pox, measles, mumps, impetigo conjunctivitis,
            hepatitis A, diarrheal diseases, lice, scabies, pinworm, ringworm,
            certain other viral or bacterial infections
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also, the following symptoms could indicate a contagious disease:
          </p>
          <ul>
            fever, lethargy, diarrhea, sore throat, vomiting, reddened, weeping
            eyes, skin eruptions / rash, constant sneezing / productive cough
            runny nose
          </ul>
          <p>
            If your child is exposed to or contracts a communicable disease, it
            is essential that you call the nursery school to tell us. In turn,
            we will send a letter home to inform parents that your child has
            been exposed to a communicable disease.
          </p>
