          <p>
            Families are invited to a school gathering at the beginning and end
            of the school year. “Popsicles at the Park” is held the week prior
            to school starting. This fun family event at Shaw Park allows
            children and parents to get acquainted with new classmates and their
            teachers. The last week of school families gather for a
            dinner/potluck at Shaw Park to celebrate the culmination of the
            year.

          <p>
            In October, WUNS holds an “open house” for current children and
            their families. This event allows parents and siblings to visit the
            child’s classroom, meet the teachers and play on the playground.
            Children are excited to “show-off” their school to their family.

        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            We arrange times throughout the year to have the WUNS playground
            open after school from 3:15-5:00 p.m. so children and their families
            can play. Siblings are welcome to join. All children must have a
            parent or caregiver present to attend.

          <br />
          <p>
            Parents are invited to our annual Halloween parade followed by songs
            and snack in their child’s classroom. An invitation and details will
            be shared with all parents.

        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            Parents are invited to enjoy time to play in the classroom and a
            special snack with their preschoolers during these special days
            (fall and spring). Children will bring home invitations and details
            about each event.

        <div class="panel">

          <p>
            The Nursery School partners with local restaurants to provide social
            gatherings for families. On these Dine Out Nights, families and
            friends are encouraged to eat out at the designated restaurant.
            Families enjoy having a meal with fellow WUNS classmates and
            parents, while also supporting the Nursery School.

        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            In February, the Nursery School rents the early childhood section of
            the Magic House for Nursery School families. This special night is a
            huge hit with everyone. Parents can enjoy a private night at their
            child’s favorite hands-on museum!

        <button class="accordion">Annual Parent Social</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <br />
          <p>
            In early spring, parents are invited to a “parent-only” social
            event. In the past it has been a trivia night, gallery night
            (highlighting preschooler’s artwork), and/or silent auction. Monies
            raised help support our enrichment programs – Art, Spanish, Nature
            and Music, as well as specific equipment or school needs.
