        <h2>
          The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and
          assess children’s progress on an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently
          plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to meet students’
          needs.
        </h2>
        <p>
          If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum
          may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the
            child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student
            confidence
          </li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
          <li>
            Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than
            previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in
            the learning process
          </li>
          <li>
            Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities
            around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring).
          Teachers take note of students’ activities throughout the year in
          order to learn about each child, plan for individual and group needs,
          and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference
          is informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the
          activities and progress of their child, and answer any questions they
          may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The Spring
          conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form
          covering all areas of the curriculum, including personal observations,
          in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each child. The
          assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that
          parents have time to read and understand the material, and form
          questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
